  <p style ="font-family:Arial;">The world is full of fascinating places. Planning the perfect vacation involves packing up, leaving home, and experiencing something new.</p>

  <h2 class="destination">1. Florence, Italy</h2>
  <div class="description">A city-size shrine to the Renaissance, Florence offers frescoes, sculptures, churches, palaces, and other monuments from the richest cultural flowering the world has known.

  <h2 class="destination">2. Beijing, China</h2>
  <div class="description">A city in the midst of reinventing itself and continuing to build on the success of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing is a place of frenzied construction. New housing, new roads, and new sports venues seem to spring up overnight. At the same time, the capital of the Peoples Republic of China remains an epicenter of tradition, with the treasures of nearly 2,000 years as the imperial capital still on viewin the famed Forbidden City and in the luxuriant pavilions and gardens of the Summer Palace.

  <h2 class="destination">3. Seoul, South Korea</h2>

Fourteenth-century city gates squat in the shadow of 21st-century skyscrapers, while the broad Han River is back-dropped by granite mountains rising in the city centercomplete with alpine highways speeding around their contours and temples nestling among their crags. Fashionable, gadget-laden youths battle for sidewalk space with fortune-tellers and peddlers, while tiny neighborhoods of traditional cottages contrast with endless ranks of identical apartments.

  <title>The Rise of Soccer in The US</title>

    <h1>How the Rise of Soccer in the US Is Changing the Face of Youth Sports</h1>
    <h2>The focus on soccer in youth sports programs is exploding nation-wide</h2>
    <p>When the first World Cup arrived in the US in the 90's everyone officially declared that soccer was it. Well it's taken it's time but we can definitely see the influence of soccer, especially women's soccer, across the US. This year, 3 million kids
      played in youth soccer leagues with 2/3 of those leagues for girls. In fact, in the 12-17 age range the MLS has surpassed the MLB and NFL in popularity.</p>
    <p>Part of this meteoric rise can be attributed to the impressively soaring ad dollars being pumped into the Women's World Cup games in 2014. The women's games generated $40 million for Fox, that's definitely not chump change. And those advertisers,
      like ATT, Coca Cola, Verizon, Nike, Visa, and other heavy hitters, are working to make sure they see those numbers grow year after year by investing in youth soccer facilities and promoting programs across the country. </p>
    <p>Now that big business is involved you can be assured you'll see a continued rise in popularity in soccer across the country for years to come. </p>

      <h1>Conservation Efforts at Lake Tahoe Being Praised by Nation's Leaders</h1>

  <div id="main" class="content">
    <h3>THE STATE'S LATEST CONSERVATION EFFORTS ARE BEING HERALDED BY NATION'S TOP LEADERS AS GROUNDBREAKING AND FORWARD THINKING.</h3>
    <span class="byline">WRITTEN BY: JAMES JAYCE</span>
    <p>Until recently, construction on the banks of the Lake had been largely under the control of real estate developers. Construction activities have resulted in a clouding of the lake's blue waters. Currently, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency is regulating construction along the shoreline and has won two Federal Supreme Court battles over recent decisions. These regulations are unpopular with many residents, especially those in the Tahoe Lakefront Homeowners Association.</p>

    <p>The League to Save Lake Tahoe (Keep Tahoe Blue) has been an environmental watchdog in the Lake Tahoe Basin for 50 years. Founded when a proposal to build a four-lane highway around the lake (with a bridge over the entrance to Emerald Bay) was proposed in 1957, the League has thwarted poorly designed development projects and environmentally unsound planning. The League embraces responsible and diversified use of the Lake's resources while protecting and restoring its natural attributes.</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">
      <h2>"THE LEAGUE EMBRACES RESPONSIBLE AND DIVERSIFIED USE OF THE LAKE'S RESOURCES WHILE PROTECTING AND RESTORING ITS NATURAL ATTRIBUTES"</h2>
    </div>

    <p>Since 1980, the Lake Tahoe Interagency Monitoring Program (LTIMP) has been measuring stream discharge and concentrations of nutrients and sediment in up to 10 tributary streams in the Lake Tahoe Basin, California-Nevada. The objectives of the LTIMP are to acquire and disseminate the water quality information necessary to support science-based environmental planning and decision making in the basin. The LTIMP is a cooperative program with support from 12 federal and state agencies with interests in the Tahoe Basin. This data set, together with more recently acquired data on urban runoff water quality, is being used by the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board to develop a program (mandated by the Clean Water Act) to limit the flux of nutrients and fine sediment to the Lake.</p>

    <p>UC Davis remains a primary steward of the lake. The UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center is dedicated to research, education and public outreach, and to providing objective scientific information for restoration and sustainable use of the Lake Tahoe Basin. Each year, it produces a well-publicized "State of the Lake" assessment report.</p>

  <div class="roasting">
    <h3>A Note on Roasting</h3>
    <p>Roasting coffee transforms the chemical and physical properties of raw coffee beans into roasted coffee products. This process is what produces the characteristic flavor of coffee by causing the green coffee beans to change in taste. Many coffee roasters determine the level of roast by eye, assessing the color of the beans to determine the desired roast-level.</p>
  <br>
      <div class="spectrum">
        <div class="green">
          <h4>Green Beans</h4>
          <h5>22&degC (72&degF)</h5>
          <p>Green coffee as it arrives at the dock. They can be stored for approximately 12-18 months in a climate controlled environment before quality loss is noticeable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="light">
          <h4>Light Roast</h4>
          <h5>205&degC (401&degF)</h5>
          <p>Moderate light brown, but still mottled in appearance. A preferred roast for some specialty roasters, highlights origin characteristics as well as complex acidity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="city">
          <h4>City Roast</h4>
          <h5>219&degC (426&degF)</h5>
          <p>Medium brown, common for most specialty coffee. Good for tasting origin character, although roast character is noticeable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="vienna">
          <h4>Vienna Roast</h4>
          <h5>230&degC (446&degF)</h5>
          <p>Moderate dark brown with light surface oil, more bittersweet, caramel flavor, acidity muted. In the middle of second crack. Any origin characteristics have become eclipsed by roast at this level.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="italian">
          <h4>Italian Roast</h4>
          <h5>245&degC (473&degF)</h5>
          <p>Nearly black and shiny, burnt tones become more distinct, acidity nearly eliminated, thin body.</p>

      <h2>Brazil</h2>
      <p>Arabica dominates both Brazil and the world as a whole with about 85% of the production; robusta accounts for the remaining 30%. In Brazil, arabica production is located in the main coffee-growing cluster of states led by Rio where arabica is
        produced almost exclusively. Robusta is primarily grown in the northwestern much smaller state of Espirito Santo where about 80% of the coffee is robusta.</p>

    <li>
      <h2>Colombia</h2>
      <p>Colombia has a reputation as producing mild, well balanced coffee beans.Colombia's average annual coffee production of 11.5 million bags is the third total highest in the world, after Brazil and Vietnam; though highest in terms of the arabica
        bean. The beans are exported to United States, Germany, France, Japan, and Italy. Most coffee is grown in the Colombian coffee growing axis region.</p>

      <h2>India</h2>
      <p>Indian coffee, grown mostly in southern India under monsoon rainfall conditions, is also termed as Indian monsooned coffee". Its flavor is defined as: "At its best similar to the flavor characteristics of Pacific coffees, but at its worst bland and uninspiring. The two well known species of coffee grown are the Arabica and Robusta. Probably the most commonly planted Arabica in India and Southeast Asia is S.795.</p>

    <h1>Typography</h1>
      <p>While typography has been practiced for many centuries, digital font design is a relatively new discipline. There are some great examples of old-school fonts (also called typefaces) which have been adapted for use on digital displays. However, I would like to highlight a few of my favorite fonts that were created with screens in mind.</p>

    <div class="editorial">
      <h2>Serif</h2>
      <p>Serifs are the small features at the end of strokes within letters. These features are <strong>functional as well as decorative</strong>. Serif fonts are widely used for body text (eg. articles) because they are considered easier to read than sans-serif fonts in print.</p>
      <p><em>Serif fonts can often create a feeling of traditionalism and antiquity, due to their common use in printed materials for many years.</em></p>

    <!-- Editorial Section - Sans-Serif -->
    <div class="editorial">
      <h2>Sans-Serif</h2>
      <p>Sans-Serif ("without serif") describes fonts with characters which lack flourishes at the ends of the strokes. Sans-serif fonts have become the most prevalent for display of text on computer screens, as on lower-resolution digital displays, fine details like serifs may disappear or appear too large.</p>
      <p><em>Sans-serif fonts are often used to project an image of simplicity, modernity or minimalism.</em></p>

    <!-- Editorial - Monospaced -->
    <div class="editorial">
      <h2>Monospaced</h2>
      <p>A monospaced font's characters each occupy the same amount of horizontal space. This contrasts with most fonts, where the letters and spacings have different widths. For example, the two high-use letters "I" and "E" do not need the same footprint. The first monospaced Western typefaces were designed for typewriters.</p>
      <p><em>Many text editors (like those used to write computer code) use monospaced fonts, which aid in distinguishing between potentially similar characters (like "l" and "1") and in counting the number of characters in a line.</em></p>
